# Proyecto ETL con Excel y Python

    Missing Value Handling: Converts specific columns to numeric types and fills missing values with the mean.
    Category Transformation: Replaces redundant category names with standardized names.
    Additional Columns: Creates new columns for day, month, impressions in thousands, cost per unit, and best practice flag.
